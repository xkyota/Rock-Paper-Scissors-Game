# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

A simple C program that allows the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.

How It Works
The user is prompted to choose:

- 0 for Rock
- 1 for Paper
- 2 for Scissors

  The computer randomly selects one of the three options.

The program compares the choices and determines the winner based on the classic rules:

- Rock beats Scissors
- Paper beats Rock
- Scissors beats Paper

Finally, the result is displayed: Win, Lose, or Tie.
